# RunnR

RunnR contains R funcations for importing and analyzing line analysis data. The scripts are written to work with the .txt files generated by the Keyence Analyzer software, and will generate the graphical display of the line analysis as well as run cursory statistical correlations.

1) **RunnR.R - Version 0.5 (Runnin' Down a Dream)** takes a text file input generated out of the Keyence Analyzer. Because of this, it is limited to only 3 colors (RBG). In the future, additional work is planned to increase this number, as well as automate peak calling. The current verion begins with *ldata(*csv*)* to generate a single graph and a correlation between your green and blue values.
